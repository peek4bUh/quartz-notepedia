# Remove Ads in MIUI

## Revoking authorization of the MSA app

The MSA app, which is short for "MIUI System Ads." To disable it, go to **Settings > Additional Settings > Authorization and Revocation**, and select **msa** from the list. Click on the toggle, wait for the 10-second timer to pass, and then revoke. If you are not successful in the first attempt, keep trying until you eventually are. Revoking authorization for MSA should drastically reduce the number of ads strewn across the system.

## Advertising identifier

Go to **Settings > Additional Settings > Privacy > User Experience Program** or **Settings > Privacy > Usage & Diagnostics**. Turn off the only toggle present there. This does not affect the number of ads, but it will no longer tailor them and collect information to do so, as it claims.

## APK installer/virus scanner

For this, install any application from the Play Store in order to trigger the APK installer to "scan" the app. While the scanning is in progress, click the **cog-wheel Settings icon** on the top right, go to **Advanced settings** and toggle off the "**Receive Recommendations"** option. You can also disable the security scan function on this screen, in case you want to.

## Installed Apps

Navigate to **Settings > Installed Apps** or **Settings > Apps > Manage apps**, click the three-dot menu on the top right corner and open "**Settings**" and disable "**Recommendations**."

## File Manager

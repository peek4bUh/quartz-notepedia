# Ducky One Volume Keys

To use media keys you must record a macro to bind the media function to a hotkey combination, i.e. `Fn` plus some key.

Enter in macro mod to record is: `Fn` + `Alt` + `Tab`.

### Example

_Important:_ In the instructions below, "Press `X+Y+Z`" means press and hold key `X`, press and hold key `Y`, press and hold key `Z` _in that order_, and then release all three.

As an example, to bind `Fn+PgUp` to the play/pause media function:

- Press `Fn+2` to activate profile #2. Profile #1 (factory default) is not programmable. Indicator lights will flash twice.
- Press and hold `Fn+Ctrl` for 3 seconds to start recording a macro. Indicator lights will flash slowly.
- Press `Fn+PgUp` to define the `Fn+PgUp` hotkey combo. Indicator lights will flash quickly.
- Press `Fn+Win+D` to bind the key combo to the play/pause function. Indicator lights will continue to flash quickly.
- Press `Fn+Ctrl` to complete recording. Indicator lights will stop flashing.
- The media key is now bound. Press `Fn+PgUp` to play/pause.

### Resetting

To reset the current profile and clear all bindings, press and hold `Win+Space` for 3 seconds. The indicator lights will flash for a short while.

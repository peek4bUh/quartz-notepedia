## Decks

> Groups of flashcards. When studying, you study one deck at a time.

In general, is recommend to putting all your cards into one or two decks. Splitting your cards up into many decks makes answering cards artificially easier. For example, if you had a deck just for “animal names”, when reviewing cards in that deck, your brain would automatically know that the answer must be an animal name. This “hint” would make recalling the answer easier. Since you won’t have these sorts of hints to rely on in real life, it’s best to practice without them.

## Notes

> The most basic unit of Anki is a “note”, which is an abstract idea. You can’t touch and hold a note, which makes it all the more perplexing. A note is a collection of data that belongs together.

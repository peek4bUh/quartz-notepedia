# How to Be a Good Hacker

To be a good hacker you have to think outside the box to try to identify possible attack vectors on vulnerable machines because it's an essential part of the “hacker mentality” to solve complex problems. Remember that you can't learn everything because the field of information security is huge and continuously evolving, it's impossible to know everything about everything.

Every programming language has its own strengths and weaknesses. If you can obtain a deep understanding of a single programming language, you will learn others much faster because the foundations in the most programming languages are the same.

You don't need to learn every programming language to understand how to read their code. All of them follow the same principles which R. D. Tennent initially defined:

1. _The Principle of Abstraction_
2. _The Principle of Correspondence_
3. _The Principle of Data Type Completeness_

In information security, you have to learn and understand these principles, structures, and processes quickly. Additionally, you have to adapt your knowledge to the various environments you encounter. You will have many situations where you won't understand how "it" works because is the first time you encounter with that or you need more time to understand the possible attack vector.

Watching videos of more experienced hackers like IppSec, s4vitar, etc... I have discovered that the most important things are:

- Build a strong methodology
- Take efficient notes
- Adapt to the environment you are working in
- Use writeups when you are stuck for a long time or learning something new
- Know how to search and look for the information you need

The 90% of penetration testing consists of research done on the internet about the product you are testing. The ability to research effectively is the skill you need to continuously adapt and evolve into your top quality.

# Learning Efficiency

The problem here is the sheer size of the information security or another programming related field. There is a lot to learn and many topics to cover. I need to understand how things work, how they are structured, and how to use them.

The primary and most difficult objective I must overcome is the _combination_ of my knowledge, adaptation, and new information.

Another major problem I must solve is handling this massive amount of information and adapting it to my strengths and weaknesses.

To learn something, first of all, I have to fail. It is an _unavoidable_ and _essential_ part of _learning_. This is one of the parts of the learning process which will make me better. Experience is built on failures. It explains that I know how to handle different and sometimes adverse situations where something does not work as expected.

I need to learn how to:

- Learn faster
- Structure the knowledge
- Find the information I need
- Get the overview

## What does it mean to be good in something?

To be good at something means I know **what I am doing**. If I know what I'm doing, that means that I'm _experienced_ with this topic. Experience means I have a vast _repertoire_ in this field. Repertoire comes from _associations_ and _practical experience_.

There is something called the "10,000-Hour Rule," which explains that I need to spend 10,000 hours on becoming good at something. I don't want to spend 10,000 hours learning a skill.

The _Pareto principle_ states that with 20% of the effort, I can achieve 80% of the effect. Conversely, this means that with 80% of the effort, I can achieve the remaining 20% of the effect, which is 100% missing. However, it is essential to note that it does not apply to everything but is a general rule applied to specific areas.

As Josh Kaufman explained in a TEDx talk, I can become excellent pretty fast. This is the so-called _learning curve_, including active and passive learning. These active and passive learning types can be found in the learning pyramid.

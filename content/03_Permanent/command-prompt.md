# Command Prompt

A **command prompt** or **prompt** is a sequence of one or more characters used in a [[command-line-interface|command-line Interface]] to indicate that it is ready to accept commands.

A **prompt** usually ends with one of the characters `$`, `%`, `#`, `:`, `>` or `-` and often includes other information, such as the path of the current working directory and the hostname.

On many [[Unix]] and [[Unix-like]] systems, the **prompt** commonly ends in `$` or `%` if the user is a normal user or in `#` if the user is a superuser.

Advanced users can customize their prompts. Depending on the environment, you can use colors, special characters, and other elements such as the user, hostname, working directory, etc., to make the **prompt** more informative or more beautiful.

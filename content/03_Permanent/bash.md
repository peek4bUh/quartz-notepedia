**Bash** is the [[shell|shell]], or [[command language interpreter]], for the **GNU** [[Operating System]]. The name is an acronym for the "**B**ourne-**A**gain **Sh**ell", a pun on Stephen Bourne, the author of the direct ancestor of the current Unix shell sh.

**Bash** is largely compatible with [[Sh]] and incorporates useful features from the
[[Korn Shell]] and the [[C Shell]].

While the **GNU** [[Operating System]] provides other shells, including a version of csh, **Bash**
is the default [[shell|shell]]. Like other GNU software, **Bash** is quite portable. It currently runs on nearly every version of Unix and a few other Operating Systems âˆ’ independently-supported ports exist for ms-dos, os/2, and Windows platforms.

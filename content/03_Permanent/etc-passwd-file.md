# /etc/passwd File

The `/etc/passwd` file contains basic user attributes. This is an ASCII file that contains an entry for each user. Each entry defines the basic attributes applied to a user.

Attributes in an entry are separated by a colon (`:`). For this reason, you should not use a colon (`:`) in any attribute.

An entry in the `/etc/passwd` file has the following form:

```
Name:Password:UID:GID:GECOS:HomeDirectory:Shell
```

| Attribute                                   | Definition                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

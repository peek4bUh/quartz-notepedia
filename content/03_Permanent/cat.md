# cat

The `cat` [[command|command]] reads files sequentially, writing them to standard output. The name is derived from its function to (con)<span class="highlight">cat</span>enate files (from Latin catenare, "to chain").

The other primary purpose of `cat`, aside from concatenation, is file printing â€” allowing the computer user to view the contents of a file. Printing to files and the terminal are the most common uses of `cat`

# /usr/local Directory

The `/usr/local` directory is where programs that are not included with your distribution but are intended for system-wide use are installed. Programs compiled from source code are normally installed in `/usr/local/bin`. On a newly installed Linux system, this tree exists, but it will be empty until the system administrator puts something in it.

The **Internet** is one giant network that consists of many small networks within itself.

The first iteration of the Internet was within the ARPANET project in the late 1960s. However, it wasn't until 1989 when the Internet as you know it was invented by Tim Berners-Lee by the creation of the World Wide Web (**WWW**). It wasn't until this point that the Internet started to be used as a repository for storing and sharing information, just like it is today.

These small networks can be one of two types:

- A private network
- A public network

# Enumeration

**Enumeration** is the process of document the current state of the target to learn as much as possible to discover potential attack vectors in the system.

The objective in this phase is not speed but meticulousness. If a resource on the target is missed during the **enumeration** phase of your test, you might lose a vital attack vector which would have potentially cut your worktime on the target in half or even less.

Is used to gather the following:

- Usernames, group names
- Hostnames
- Network shares and services
- IP tables and routing tables
- Service settings and audit configurations
- Application and banners
- SNMP and DNS details

The `sudo` [[command|command]] is like [[su-reference|su]] in many ways but has some important additional capabilities. The administrator can configure `sudo` to allow an ordinary user to execute commands as a different user in a controlled way.

A user may be restricted to one or more specific commands and no others. Another important difference is that the use of `sudo` does not require access to the superuser's password. Authenticating using `sudo` requires the user's own password.

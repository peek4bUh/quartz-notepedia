# Bash Prompt Colors

Character color is controlled by sending the [[Terminal Emulator|terminal emulator]] an ANSI escape code embedded in the stream of characters to be displayed. The control code does not print out on the display; rather, it is interpreted by the terminal as an instruction.

The `\[` and `\]` [[Bash Prompt Escape Sequences|sequences]] are used to encapsulate non-printing characters. An ANSI escape code begins with an octal `033` (the code generated by the `ESC` key), followed by an optional character attribute, followed by an instruction.

Colors are divided into two groups: normal characters (`0`) and bold characters (`1`).

| Sequence     | Text color | Sequence     | Text color   |
| ------------ | ---------- | ------------ | ------------ |
| `\033[0;30m` | Black      | `\033[1;30m` | Dark gray    |
| `\033[0;31m` | Red        | `\033[1;31m` | Light red    |
| `\033[0;32m` | Green      | `\033[1;32m` | Light green  |
| `\033[0;33m` | Brown      | `\033[1;33m` | Yellow       |
| `\033[0;34m` | Blue       | `\033[1;34m` | Light blue   |
| `\033[0;35m` | Purple     | `\033[1;35m` | Light purple |
| `\033[0;36m` | Cyan       | `\033[1;36m` | Light cyan   |
| `\033[0;37m` | Light Gray | `\033[1;37m` | White        |

Here is an example to make a red prompt:

```
[tux@linuxbox ~]$ PS1="\[\033[\033[0;31m\][\u@\h \W]\$"
```

This works, but all the text that you type after the prompt will also display in red. To fix this, you will add another escape code to the end of the prompt that tells the terminal emulator tor return to the previous color.

```
[tux@linuxbox ~]$ PS1="\[\033[\033[0;31m\][\u@\h \W]\$\[\033[0m\] "
```

It's also possible to set the text background color using the codes listed in the table before. The background colors do not support the bold attribute.

| Sequence     | Text color |
| ------------ | ---------- |
| `\033[0;40m` | Black      |
| `\033[0;41m` | Red        |
| `\033[0;42m` | Green      |
| `\033[0;43m` | Brown      |
| `\033[0;44m` | Blue       |
| `\033[0;45m` | Purple     |
| `\033[0;46m` | Cyan       |
| `\033[0;47m` | Light gray |

You can create a prompt with a red background by applying a simple change to the first escape code:

```
[tux@linuxbox ~]$ PS1="\[\033[0;41m\][\u@\h \W]\$\[\033[0m\] "
```

> [!note]
> Besides the normal (`0`) and bold (`1`) character attributes, text may be given underscore (`4`), blinking (`5`) and inverse (`7`) attributes. In the interests of good taste, many terminal emulators refuse to honor the blinking attribute, however.

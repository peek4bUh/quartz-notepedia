# Windows Remote Management

Windows Remote Management, or WinRM, is a Windows-native built-in remote management protocol that basically uses Simple Object Access Protocol to interact with remote computers and servers, as well as Operating Systems and applications. WinRM allows the user to :

- Remotely communicate and interface with hosts
- Execute commands remotely on systems that are not local to you but are network accessible.
- Monitor, manage and configure servers, operating systems and client machines from a remote location

As a pentester, this means that if we can find credentials (typically username and password) for a user who has remote management privileges, we can potentially get a PowerShell shell on the host.

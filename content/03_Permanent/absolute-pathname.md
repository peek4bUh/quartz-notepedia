An **absolute pathname** begins with the [[root-directory|root directory]] (`/`) and follows the tree branch by branch until the path to the desired directory or file completed.

For instance, `/home/tux/example.txt` tells you to start at the `/home` directory on your hard drive and then click into the `tux` directory, where you'll find a text file called `example.txt`.

# /var/log/kern.log File

The `/var/log/kern.log` file contains information about the system's kernel (hardware drivers, system calls, kernel events, etc...).

Kernel logs can reveal the presence of vulnerable or outdated drivers, provide insights about system crashes, resource limitations, identify suspicious system calls or other activities that could indicate the presence of malware or other malicious software on the system.

By monitoring the this file, you can detect any unusual behavior and take appropriate action to prevent further damage to the system.
